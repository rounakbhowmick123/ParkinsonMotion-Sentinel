# Automatic-Sign-Face-Detection

This project aims to develop an analysis tool for detecting and understanding Freezing of Gait (FoG) in individuals with Parkinson's Disease. FoG is a common and debilitating symptom characterized by a sudden and brief inability to initiate or continue movement. Early detection and effective analysis of FoG episodes can contribute to improved patient care and management.

## Usage

1> Clinical Assessment and Monitoring:

Usage: Healthcare professionals can utilize the tool to conduct clinical assessments of Parkinson's Disease patients.
Benefit: Enables continuous monitoring of gait patterns and provides insights into the frequency and severity of Freezing of Gait episodes, aiding in personalized treatment plans.

2> Research and Data Analysis:

Usage: Researchers in the field of Parkinson's Disease can employ the tool to analyze gait data collected during clinical trials or research studies.
Benefit: Facilitates comprehensive data analysis, helping researchers identify patterns, correlations, and potential factors contributing to Freezing of Gait, advancing our understanding of the condition.

3> Rehabilitation and Therapeutic Interventions:

Usage: Physical therapists and rehabilitation specialists can incorporate the tool into gait training programs for Parkinson's Disease patients.
Benefit: Provides real-time feedback on gait performance, allowing therapists to tailor interventions and exercises to address specific challenges related to Freezing of Gait.

4> Remote Patient Monitoring:

Usage: Caregivers and remote healthcare providers can use the tool for remote monitoring of Parkinson's Disease patients.
Benefit: Enables caregivers to observe and analyze gait patterns remotely, fostering timely interventions and adjustments to the patient's care plan based on the detected instances of Freezing of Gait.
